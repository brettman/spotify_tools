# Spotify Tools - Project Context

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-31

## Project Status: Production Ready - Analytics Phase

### Current Phase
Core sync functionality complete and tested. Currently implementing analytics and reporting capabilities.

---

## Project Vision

A tool to fetch Spotify library data (tracks, albums, artists, playlists), store it locally in PostgreSQL, and perform custom analytics focusing on audio features (tempo, key, etc.).

**Key Goals:**
- Offline access to Spotify library metadata
- Custom analytics and reporting (especially tempo/key analysis)
- Extensible for future external data sources (MusicBrainz, etc.)
- Multi-client support (CLI now, web interface later)
- Automated sync capabilities (cron jobs)

### Phase 6: Analytics Service ⏳
**Started:** 2025-12-31

**Analytics Service (SpotifyTools.Analytics):**
- ✅ IAnalyticsService interface with search and report methods
- ✅ AnalyticsService implementation (~200 lines)
- ✅ TrackDetailReport data model with nested classes
- ✅ ReportFormatter with beautiful CLI output
- ✅ CLI integration (menu option 4)

**Features Completed:**
- Track search by name (top 10 results)
- Comprehensive track detail report showing:
  - Basic track info (name, duration, popularity, ISRC, added date)
  - Artist details (name, genres, popularity, followers)
  - Album information (type, release date, label, total tracks)
  - Audio Features with visual bars:
    - Musical characteristics (tempo, key, mode, time signature, loudness)
    - Mood & feel (danceability, energy, valence)
    - Audio qualities (acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness)
  - Playlists containing the track
- Key name translation (0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, etc.)
- Mode display (Major/Minor)
- Time signature display (4/4, 3/4, etc.)

**Next Step - Audio Analysis Enhancement:**
- 📋 **Enhance track detail report with Spotify Audio Analysis data**
  - Integrate `audio-analysis` endpoint (separate from `audio-features`)
  - Show section-by-section breakdown with timestamps
  - Display key changes throughout the song
  - Show tempo variations across sections
  - Detect structural changes (verse/chorus/bridge transitions)
  - Particularly valuable for progressive rock and jazz with time signature changes
  - Example use case: "Thick as a Brick" by Jethro Tull with multiple key/time changes
  - Add optional detailed view or separate menu option
  - Consider storing analysis data in database for offline access

## Planned Architecture (In Progress)

### Technology Stack
- **Language:** C# / .NET 8
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Docker containerized)
- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core (initial), migrate to Dapper later
- **Auth:** OAuth with encrypted refresh token storage
- **Rate Limiting:** 60 requests/min to Spotify API

### Project Structure
```
SpotifyTools.sln
├── src/
│   ├── SpotifyTools.Domain/           # Shared entities/models
│   ├── SpotifyTools.Data/             # Data access layer (EF Core)
│   ├── SpotifyTools.Spotify/          # Spotify API client (rename from SpotifyClientService)
│   ├── SpotifyTools.Sync/             # Sync orchestration
│   ├── SpotifyTools.Analytics/        # Analytics & reporting (PRIMARY FOCUS)
│   └── SpotifyTools.CLI/              # Console interface
└── tests/                              # Future unit tests
```

### Database Schema
**Core Tables:**
- `tracks` - Track metadata (name, duration, popularity, ISRC, timestamps)
- `artists` - Artist info (name, genres, popularity, followers)
- `albums` - Album details (name, release date, label)
- `audio_features` - **KEY TABLE** (tempo, key, mode, energy, danceability, etc.)
- `playlists` - Playlist metadata
- `spotify_tokens` - Encrypted OAuth refresh tokens

**Relationships:**
- `track_artists` - Many-to-many with position tracking
- `track_albums` - Track/album linking with disc/track numbers
- `playlist_tracks` - Playlist contents with positions

**Sync Tracking:**
- `sync_history` - Track full/incremental sync operations

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Authentication Strategy**
- Store encrypted refresh tokens in PostgreSQL
- Support automated cron jobs
- Multi-account capable
- Smooth path to future web app

**2. Rate Limiting**
- Max 60 requests/min to stay under Spotify limits
- Prioritize completeness over speed
- Expected: ~6-7 hours for full import of 10k tracks

**3. Sync Strategy**
- **Phase 1:** Full import (all saved tracks, artists, albums, audio features, playlists)
- **Phase 2:** Incremental sync (compare snapshots, fetch new/changed only)
- Manual trigger via CLI, cron-job capable

**4. Analytics Focus**
- Tempo analysis and distribution
- Key/mode distribution (for DJ mixing)
- Genre statistics
- Custom queries via dedicated Analytics service layer
- Extensible report interface

**5. Future Extensibility**
- PostgreSQL JSONB for flexible extended metadata
- Support for external data sources (MusicBrainz for producers/mixers)
- Web interface migration path
- Dapper migration for complex analytics queries

## Important Notes

### Configuration
- `appsettings.json` contains Spotify credentials and database connection (gitignored)
- Use `appsettings.json.template` as reference
- **OAuth redirect URI:** `http://127.0.0.1:5009/callback` (must match in Spotify Dashboard)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on port 5433 (Docker container)
- **Connection String:** `Host=localhost;Port=5433;Database=spotify_tools;Username=spotify_user;Password=...`

### Spotify API Notes
- Genres come from artists, not tracks
- Rate limits: ~180 req/min (we use 60 to be safe)
- Required scopes: `UserLibraryRead`, `PlaylistModifyPublic`, `PlaylistModifyPrivate`
- Audio features require separate API calls per track

### Architecture Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each service has one clear purpose
- **Repository Pattern** - Abstract data access for testability
- **Dependency Injection** - Constructor injection throughout
- **Interface-based design** - Easy to mock and test

## Questions to Resolve
- [x] CLI framework choice → **Simple menu system (implemented)**
- [ ] Exact external data sources for enrichment (future: MusicBrainz)
- [ ] Backup/export strategy for PostgreSQL data
- [ ] OAuth token refresh strategy (currently browser-based, future: refresh token storage)
- [ ] Incremental sync implementation strategy
- [ ] Analytics visualization (CLI tables vs future web interface)
